# Car Rental Service

This is a console application for a car rental service that allows users to rent cars and return them. 
It uses CSV files to store the car fleet and the rentals.

### Prerequisites

You would need the following tools installed before running the project locally:

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any preferred IDE)

### Usage

To run the project, you would need to clone the repository and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.
The repository includes created csv files for the specified file paths in the code.
The project currently does not automatically generate the CSV files, thus it won't work without them.
